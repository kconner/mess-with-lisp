;; The order of growth in the number of steps needed to encode a symbol
;; is, in the worst case, linear with the number of possible symbols,
;; but log n in the best overall case when the tree is balanced,
;; and constant in the best specific case when there is a single symbol
;; that's more common than the rest combined.
